# DiscordBot-GPT3

# Discord bot "Assistant" powered by OpenAi's GPT-3 API. 
# ran out of API calls, will on standby until further use case justifies a paid API system.
# lacking functionality to send attachment responses since Discord has a max limit on how many chararacters it will allow, have to implement this and then the GPT-3 DIscord bot is complete.

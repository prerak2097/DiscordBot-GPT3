# DiscordBot-GPT3

 Discord bot "Assistant" powered by OpenAi's GPT-3 API. 
 Ran out of API calls, will on standby until further use case justifies a paid API subscription.
 Lacking functionality to send attachment responses since Discord has a max limit on how many chararacters it will allow, have to implement this and then the GPT-3 DIscord bot is complete.
